# Bachelor Thesis

This repo includes my three-year thesis work performed during my Computer Science studies at the University of Pisa. 

Specifically, I performed a comparative analysis, carried out on **5 biometric datasets**, between **4 models of recurrent neural networks**: **Simple-RNN**, **LSTM**, **GRU** and **ESN** (Echo-State-Network). The main objective of the work is to demonstrate the reliability of Reservoir Computing, able to offer high performance despite a much lower level of complexity. This in order to implement an **emotional state prediction system within devices wearable** (such as smartband) with low computational complexity, but with relevant performances. The language used is **Python**, in particular the **TensorFlow**, **Keras** and **scikit-learn** libraries.

The work was then published: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-85099-9_14.
